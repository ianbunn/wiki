### Cuāuhocēlōtl

**Cuāuhocēlōtl** is the derivative of eagle warrior and jaguar warrior, a jaguar knight.

The jaguar motif was due to the Aztec belief that the warrior would exhibit the jaguar's strength in battle.

To get to the **cuāuhocēlōtl** level, a warrior would have to capture 4 living enemies from battle, as they believed killing was a clumsy solution to battle.
