## Reality Distortion Field

What is "reality distortion field"? is "a confounding melange of a charismatic rhetorical style, an indomitable will, and an eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand".

A reality distortion field operates every single moment. It is the reality you project to the world about yourself, your abilities/limitations, strengths/weaknesses, etc.

This perceived reality of yourself becomes actual reality. You believe it, so others believe it about yourself.

Similar to "fake it till you make it", but the only main difference is that you don't allow imposter syndrome to creep in to your reality distortion field.

Examples of hacking your reality distortion field:

* If you are nervous when speaking in public, rest assured everyone picks up on it, and your unpolished speaking skills will be the reality
* If you feel intimidated when talking to that powerful client, your body language will show it, and the power gap will become a reality
* If you think you’re no good with people, you’ll always sit in the corner at the party, you’ll never get the chance to practice, and therefore your poor people skills will be the reality
* If you’re convinced you’ll never get in shape, you’ll never take the opportunity to get in shape, and therefore your flabbiness will become a reality
* If you see yourself as a leader, you’ll jump at the opportunity to lead, and therefore your leadership will become a reality

Make your beliefs about yourself self-fulfilling prophecies. You are in control of yourself. 

Hack yourself into a better version of yourself. Then hack others to help them become a better version of themselves.

What you consider "possible" and "impossible" for yourself are just ideas. These loops can be reprogrammed. You can achieve the "impossible" by training your mind to believe it is "possible".

"Anything is possible", a great foundation to start hacking your reality distortion field.

Make your internal reality so powerful to affect external reality.

May the Field be with you.

## The Code

### Attitude

Be positive and think positively.

However, **DO NOT** be a snitch, and don't talk to the cops, lawyer up.

Don't complain about others to others. Tell them to their face.

### Confidence

Do not second guess your self while in action.

Visualize the end as a success.

Don't be shy. Say what you want without the fear of sounding dumb. We are dumb. We get less dumb by saying things and getting feedback.

What is empathy? Showing the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

Be kind to people, because most of the time, the world is not.

### Time

**DO NOT WASTE TIME**.

Time is of the essence.

Time is running out.

Time is limited _for everyone_.

There are only 24 hours in the day, and only about 15 hours of them awake. Make the most of the squeezable hours.

### Unprejudiced Objectivity

Attempt to consider all vantage points, angles of a story. There’s always something missing somewhere that someone can fill in to make it whole. There are no gaps in the universe, only truths.

### Walk The Talk

Our word is all we've got.

Live by the sword, die by the sword.

### Zen

Stay calm.

Say it out loud, "everything is fine and there is nothing I can do for things outside my control." Notice what objections arise. Observe the thoughts that come to mind and write them down. Resolve those objections to come to a Zen mind.
