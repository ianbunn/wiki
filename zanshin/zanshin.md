## The Code

### Attitude

Be positive and think positively.

### Balance

Whatever is done to one side, MUST be done on the other side.

Keep balance and reciprocate.

Don't take more than what _you_ give, and only take what is needed.

### Communication

Communication is key. 

However, **DO NOT** be a snitch, and don't talk to the cops, lawyer up.

Don't complain about others to others. Tell them to their face.

### Confidence

Do not second guess your self while in action.

Visualize the end as a success.

Don't be shy. Say what you want without the fear of sounding dumb. We are dumb. We get less dumb by saying things and getting feedback.

Don't be afraid of criticism. People can smell the fear.

### Discipline

There is nothing without **discipline**, and even at that, you _gots_ to stay **consistent**.

### Educate Yourself

Never stop learning.

### Egoless

Don't be a poser. Always be yourself.

Attempt to remove the **ego** & **I** statements.

I am you, you are me, we are all It, whole, universe.

### Empathy

What is empathy? Showing the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

Be kind to people, because most of the time, the world is not.

Understand others have the right to their own taste.

Remember that others might be suffering in silence. Don't be an asshole all the time, just when it matters, for improvement's sake.

Everyone makes mistakes, encourage people that take ownership of their mistakes.

Don’t block yourself to look “cool”. Be open to talking it out, and remember everyone is a world of its own but have the same beginning and end, but not the in-betweens.

### Environment 

Design an environment that is conductive of good habits.

### Fitness

Exercise and fitness improves mood and helps with staying healthy. Exercise at least 45 minutes a day.

### Food & Diet

Eat clean. Eat healthy. Eat vegetarian, or attempt your best to minimize animal meat, including fish, and animal byproducts.

Find your favorite fruit and have it around most of the time. Do the same for your favorite vegetable to increase your fruit and vegetable intake.

### Hate

Hate arises from jealousy of others. Let go of hate and live your own life without judgement or jealousy.

If people try and fail, don't laugh or mock at them. Encourage the failures to get closer to a WIN-WIN-WIN situation (The Office reference).

### Love

Love is the constant in human life. Show love to people.

### Passion

Be passionate. People that find their passion will not work a day in their lives.

### Patience

Be patient. Patience is a virtue.

### Planning

Design plans as **SMART** goals (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound).

**REMEMBER**, plans change all the time, so don't stress. Improvise and adapt.

“Make plans and God will laugh at you.”

### Readiness

Life is a constant test, so be ready to perform at the best level all the time.

### Schedule

Scheduled things get done. No excuses.

Follow the Eisenhower Matrix to set priorities.

### Sleep

Go to sleep early to wake up early. Attempt to get 7 hours of sleep, but no less than 6 hours.

### Time

**DO NOT WASTE TIME**.

Time is of the essence.

Time is running out.

Time is limited _for everyone_.

There are only 24 hours in the day, and only about 15 hours of them awake. Make the most of the squeezable hours.

### Unprejudiced Objectivity

Attempt to consider all vantage points, angles of a story. There’s always something missing somewhere that someone can fill in to make it whole. There are no gaps in the universe, only truths.

### Walk The Talk

Our word is all we've got.

Live by the sword, die by the sword.

### Zen

Stay calm.

Say it out loud, "everything is fine and there is nothing I can do for things outside my control." Notice what objections arise. Observe the thoughts that come to mind and write them down. Resolve those objections to come to a Zen mind.
