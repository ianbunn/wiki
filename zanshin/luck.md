# Serendipity and Luck

## [How to open up to serendipity and create your own luck](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-open-up-to-serendipity-and-create-your-own-luck)

Humans find comfort in certainty and predictability. By having a "plan", we psyche ourselves to believe there's a means of our plans becoming reality. However, most of the time, plans don't succeed, but the action of reacting to the challenges and obstacles that arise from executing your plan.

Most successful people can turn the unexpected into positive outcomes. This skill is called "serendipity mindset". This is the active process of spotting gaps and seing a way to create a bridge between two unrelated things, connecting the dots for innovation. Other people refer to this as "smart luck".

On top of having this mindset, it requires a positive perception about being "lucky", otherwise, it will be hard to see the gaps to connect the dots. Keep a **"serendipity lucky mindset"**.

Be curious and be proactive.

We can improve on this **serendipity lucky mindset** by harnessing the positive coincidences that show up in life. Preparation is key. In order to prepare in the right moment, we have to recognize and challenge our biases.

### Recognize and challenge biases

#### Bias #1: underestimating the unexpected

Prepare for the worst, but also, prepare for the best.

The unexpected happens all the time. Train your mind to see the gaps by expecting the worst and the best, all the time. Sometimes referred as second order thinking (or higher).

#### Bias #2: hindsight bias

As humans, we tend to construct stories that conveniently explain everything, ignoring the **role of chance**.

This speaks to our human need to familiarize the unknown and to control anomolies.

#### Bias #3: functional fixedness

We're so used to our daily lives' tools that we don't see ways to improve or use them in new or better contexts.

Our creativity will thrive when we abandon the physical and mental tools with which we're familiar and find ways to improve them.

Keep it simple, stupid (K.I.S.S.).

### Cultivate your serendipity mindset

There are many ways to strengthen and develop the serendipity muscle.

1. **Journaling**: a way of reflection to begin decluttering your life
- Helps to stay present
- Helps to recognize serendipity moments
- Helps you stay alert about your daily activities
- Create two columns, one side list all positive things in the day and on the other side, list the negative things, then find the pattern, so you resolve some negative ones

2. **Declutter your life**: once the patterns are detected after journaling, clean up your minutiae
- Remove things that take up space in your daily life
- This will give you in return more cognitive, emotional and physical attention to dedicate to more urgent/important tasks

3. **Treat yo self**: some efforts lead to an immediate spark, but most of them take time, like planting a seed. Wait to reap what you sow. Be patient
- Above all, respect your time

4. **Practice daily serendipity**: there are plenty of strategies to do this
- "Hook strategy": find common ground and shared passions with someone to maximize serendipity
  - Ask about their current passions and interests, instead of what do you do type of questions
- "Reframe mindset": treat challenges and mistakes as opportunities, not threats
