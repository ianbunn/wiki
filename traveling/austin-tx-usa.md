# Austin TX

## Adventures & Exploring

* Zilker Park - massive public park, ~361 acres where you can find friendly futbol matches, ultimate frisbee and other sun bathing relating activities

* Green Belt - go for a hike in one of these strips of greenery
  * My latest favorite entrance spot is by Stretch & Stroll Barton Springs Trailhead, on your GPS, go ahead and set it for 1599 Spyglass Dr, Austin, TX 78746

* Barton Springs Pool - if you're into cold pools, this one is it for you, jump in to freshen up on a hot summer day

* SUP or Kayak at Town Lake, if you're into cancel culture, if not, Lady Bird Lake, named after LBJ's wife, like if the .01% doesn't have enough things named after them already
