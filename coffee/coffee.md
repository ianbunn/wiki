# Coffee

## Grind size

What size do I grind for:

- Espresso: extra fine, like powdered sugar
  - Water spends very little time w/the coffee, since espresso is brewed through pressure

- Aeropress: fine, like table salt
  - It relies on pressure and immersion brewing

- Drip/pour over: medium, like sea salt

- French press: coarse, like a flaky seasoning
  - As an immersion brewing method, French press coffee needs enough surface area from coffee grounds to extra flavor

- Cold brew: coarse, like small flakes of oatmeal
  - Bc of cold water and long brewing times, grains should be fairly coarse for slow extraction rate
