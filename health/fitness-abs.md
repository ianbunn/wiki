# Abs

## Exercises

Side plank crunch

- Begin in a side plank, and rest your free hand behind your head
- Keep your hips lifted, bend your knee, and bring your leg towards your top shoulder to touch your elbow
- Extend your leg back to the starting position
- Try to keep your body straight, avoiding leaning forward or backward

Russian twist

- Begin seated, and lean back slightly
- Keep your heels on the floor and lift your feet by a few inches
- Hold your arms straight in front of you, keeping your back at a 45-degree angle from the floor
- Twist your torso as far as you can to the right without arching your back, hold for a second, and then twist to the left
- Continue alternating sides while keeping your core engaged
- This can also be done on a stability ball, or if you want to get even more advanced, you can add in weights for more resistance

Reverse crunch

- Lie on your back with your feet on the ground and your arms by your side
- Press your lower back to the ground, and lift your knees up to a 90-degree angle
- Use your core to pull your knees into your chest and lip your hips off the floor, keeping the 90-degree angle in your knees
- Hold the crunch at the top, and then with control, lower your hips back to their original position. Focus on using your muscles, rather than momentum, to switch into each position

Single-leg squat

- begin by standing on one leg, with your toes pointed directly forward
- Lift the other leg and bend it slightly
- Keep your arms by your side and your back straight
- Slightly raise the non-supported leg, and lower to squat position in the supporting leg, keeping the knee centered
- Then raise your body and extend the leg back to where you started
- To kick things up a notch, you can use dumbbells for weighted single-leg squats

Plank tuck jump

- Begin in a plank position, with your arms a little wider than shoulder-length apart
- Tighten your core, shift your weight into your hands, and bend your knees
- Keeping your hands on the ground, jump up, lifting your hips in the air and bringing your legs into a tuck position
- Your legs should point towards your chest with your knees, and your pelvis should be moving upward
- Land into a tuck position with your feet on the floor, and then finish off the move by jumping back into a plank
