## Pirate Metrics

If you haven't heard of Pirate Metrics, it is an easy way to break down the different steps of a **customer lifecycle** that can be optimized.

* **Acquisition**: drive users to your site through various channels and get them to sign up
* **Activation**: engage users early on by having them participate with your most important feature(s)
* **Retention**: get users to come back, visit and use your product multiple times
* **Referral**: leverage users who are jazzed about your product to refer family and friends
* **Revenue**: convert users to pay you money for your services or product
