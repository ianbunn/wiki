# Leadership

## Communication

"Communication opportunities are critical. Even a brief interaction can change the way people think about themselves, their leaders, and the future" - Douglas Conant, CEO

### Communication Tactic #1 - Choose the Most Valuable Verb

The verbs below are paired with another verb that may seem interchangeable, but should NOT be used like that.

One is an accurate representation of effort, the other a misrepresentation or less inspiring conveyance of that effort:

**Enable vs. Allow**. If your effort produced a result, you actively enabled it. If you simply removed an obstacle, you merely allowed it.

**Prevent vs. Avoid**. If your action stopped something disastrous from happening, you prevented it, but if you just moved something out of peril’s way or put off that peril, you merely avoided it.

**Act vs. Address**. If you took deliberate measures to affect an issue, you acted on it, but if you simply considered the situation, you merely addressed it.

**Respond vs. React**. If a situation spurred you to action, you responded, but if the issue only triggered an emotion, you merely reacted.

**Overcome vs. Face**. If you successfully conquered an obstacle, you overcame it, but if you only encountered the obstacle or just stood your ground, you merely faced it.

**Accomplish vs. Meet (a Goal)**. If you accomplish a goal, you imply that you achieved that status as a direct result of your effort, but if you merely meet a goal, you’re only indicating that you technically hit the milestone — possibly by accident, circumstance, or gravity.

### Communication Tactic #2 - Don't "Share"

When you use the word “share” in a business setting, you’re signaling at that moment a hope that your audience will intuitively understand the value and purpose of the share. But that burden — attaching relevance to your point — should fall on you, not on your audience.

Use power powers to sell your idea: "propose", "suggest", and "recommend".

“Power words” force you to make a contention and commit to it. You’re no longer throwing thoughts out there and hoping for the best — you’re recommending ideas and asserting their worthiness, which is what leaders should be doing in their communications.

### Communication Tactic #3 - Audit Your "Ands"

The sentence with fewer descriptors and less content is more effective. That may seem counterintuitive at first, but the problem with multiple ideas is that they fight each other for attention, ultimately diluting the impact of each. “Ands” are red flags for those little conflicts.

This guidance does not mean you must banish “ands” from your lexicon like carbs from your diet. Just see them as flags to assess each occurrence. Ask yourself how much you really need multiple descriptors in a single point or sentence, knowing that even one more word means more cognitive work for your audience.
