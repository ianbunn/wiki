Delivering technology in fast-paced business environments affects:

* Funding approaches
* Shortens planning cycles
* Requires real-time feedback to adapt to change

Incorporating technology needs to start from the inside out.

When complexity and the need for speed increase, planning deficiencies become magnified:

* The key is continuous planning for business agility
* Create optimized top-down strategic plan

Understand what it takes to create plans that enable you to continuously connect strategy to delivery.

What is the definition of planning?

* OLD, static, linear processes
* Technology needs:
  * Continuous processes
  * Feedback loops
  * Results measurement

Make sure our organization is executing on its strategy by making the right investment decisions and continuously aligning these with their:

* Strategic goals
* Financial constraints
* Resource capacity

Plans must be dynamic and enable our organization to shift based on the latest data, while keeping resources aligned and mapped to outcome delivery at all times.

Our organization needs to move from annual budget-based planning to continuous planning that tightly integrates with work execution to better manage critical resources and continual value delivery:
