10 steps to solve problems

1. Assess if your problem needs to be solved
    * Why do you want to solve this problem?
    * What are the benefits and costs of solving or not solving this problem?
    * Is the benefit of solving this problem more than the benefit of not solving this problem?
    * Is the cost of solving this problem more than the cost of not solving problem?

2. Identify the underlying problem cleary
    * What is the underlying problem here?
    * Is the problem you have defined a symptom instead?
    * What could be causing your current problem now?

3. Define specific and measurable objectives
    * What are your objectives?
    * What are you trying to achieve by resolving this problem?
    * Are your objectives specific and measurable?
    * Do your objectives let you know your progress at any point in time?
    * Do your objectives help you determine if you have solved your problem or not?

4. Come up with as many solutions as you can
    * What can you do to reach your objectives?
    * What do you think is impossible to do but could help you achieve your objectives?
    * How can you achieve your objectives if you aren't limited by any constraints?
    * Who has the same problem as you?
    * How did they solve their problem?

5. Determine your constraints and refine your solutions
    * What constraints do you have that prevent you from solving your problem?
    * Is your constraint true or just an assumption?
    * Can you eliminate the constraints you have?
    * What questions can you ask yourself to come up with a better solution?
    * How can you do things differently but yet produce the same results?

6. Pick the best solution
    *
