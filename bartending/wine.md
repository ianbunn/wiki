# Wine

## Red wine

### How are red wines named?

* Red wines may be named ...
  * ...after familiar grapes, such as:
    * *cabernet sauvignon*
    * *pinot noir*
    * *malbec*
    * *zinfandel*
  * ...for the place the grames are grown, such as:
    * *Gevrey-Chambertin*
    * *Priorat*
    * *St.-Julien* or *Barolo*

## White wine

### How are white wines named?

* Like red wines, white wines will also be named by:
  * Types of grapes, such as:
    * *chardonnay*
    * *sauvignon blanc*
    * *riesling*
    * *chenin blanc*
  * Places, such as:
    * *Mâcon-Villages*
    * *Soave*
    * *Vouvray*
    * *Sancerre*

### Are all white wines made with white grapes?

Short answer is **no**.

* Ocasionally, you will see white wines labeled "**orange**" or "**amber**", or even "**skin-contact**"
  * **Skin-contact** means the producers of these wines used white grapes but employed a method for making red wines.
* It is also possible to make white wines with red grapes, by taking away the skins immediately, such as:
  * *blanc de noirs Champagne*, a white sparkling wine made from red grapes *pinot noir* or *pinot meunier* or both

## Rosé

## How is rosé made?

* Rosé is produced by starting similar to making red wine, and allow the skins to steep in the juice only enough to achieve the desired color
* Another production method is to bleed off a portion of the juice from the red wine
* This method is called *saignée*, French for "bled"
* A third method is used to make rosé Champagne, which is done by blending a bit of red into white wine

### Are rosé wines supposed to be drank when young?

* Rosés are ephemereal, meaning they should be consumed young
* There are some exceptions that age beautifully, like *Provençal rosés of Bandol*, *rosé of Château Simone*, and *rosé of Valentini*

### What's the diff btw rosé, rosado and rosato?

* Whether they are labeled rosé, rosado (Spain) or rosato (Italy), you'll be able to tell it apart by its rose color.

## Sparkling wine

There are a few methods to making sparkling wine, but there are 3 main methods.

Champagne, cava and many other sparkling wines use the method *Champenoise*, also known as the *méthode traditionelle*. This method requires the wine to be finished and be still, then, it is placed in bottles, along with some yeast and a sweet substance (often grape juice). The second fermentation begins when the yeast consumes the sugar, which produces the carbon dioxide as a byproduct (the bubbles). The gas carbonates the wine, and when it's ready, the yeast is ejected from the wine.

Inexpensive sparkling wines like mass-market *prosecco* or *Lambrusco* use the *Charmat* method, named after the French inventor Eugène Charmat. These wines are carbonated in bulk by putting the finished still wine, along with yeast and sweetness, in a pressurised tank.

The third popular method is called *méthode ancestrale*, which takes the bottled wine before the first fermentation is complete, and as the fermentation finishes in the sealed container, the sparkle is added. The carbonation is tamer and makes the wine sweeter.

Rising in popularity due to the *pétillants naturels*, which are made this way.

Other sparkling wines are *cava*, *sekt*, *creémant*, *pétillant* and *spumante*.

## Fortified wine

Fortified wines are done by adding neutral spirits to rise the alcohol level. This is done for several reasons:

1) Fortification helps to protect a wine from contamination (most microbes won't survive in higher alcohol levels)
2) Forticiation was a method of protecting fragile still wines from the rigors of long voyages
3) If a wine is fortified before fermentation is complete, the yeast will die, so it will not finish consuming the sugar. This will leave behind a more sweet taste

This is how *port* and sweeter *Madeiras* are made.

*Dry sherries* are fortified after the fermentation is complete.

Other examples of fortified wine are *sherry*, *Madeira*, *marsala*, *vermouth* and *vin doux naturels*.

## Finding the right wine shop

A good wine shop should:

* Have cool temperatures
* Have clean bottles with no dust on them
* Have wine bottles stored OUT of direct sunlight
* Have personalized bottle descriptions by staff (writting not printed)
* Have passionate staff that enjoys wine
* Never try to upsell
* Be able to recommend alternatives

## Getting help at the wine shop

Know a few things before asking for help to help the wine shop employee narrow your choices:

* Budget
* Occasion
* Type of food (you might not always know the type of food if you are taking a bottle as a gift)

### Questions to ask about the bottle you are buying

* Where is the wine from?
* Who made it?
* Big company or small estate?
* What is the **terroir** (where the grapes were grown, soils, microclimate, elevation, sun exposure, etc.)?
* What are the characteristics of the **vintage** (the year the grapes were harvested)?
* Does it farm the grapes organically?
* Is the wine producer a **négociant** (someone who purchases grapes to make the wine, or even buys the packaged wine and rebrands it)?

## Ordering at a restaurant

### The wine list

Usually, the wine list is organized by geography, or by the name of the predominant grape in the wine, or combination of the two.

#### Identifying Old World wines

Old World wines are organized by place due to its **appellation** (official wine zone which has rules about which grapes can be used).

French wine called **Gevrey-Chambertin** or **Volnay**, 2 appellations within Burgundy, these wines are made of pinot noir.

Italian wine called **Barolo** is made of the nebbiolo grape.

**New World wines** have less historical ties, so they are identified by name of the grape.

### The wine tasting

Once the wine is ordered, the wine conneiseur or sommelier will bring the bottle to the table, open it and serve a small amount to taste it. Make sure the wine is not flawed. Common flaws are **corked wine**, which leaves the wine smelling like soggy cardboard. Ask the sommelier to taste it, if you feel like it doesn't taste right to make sure all is good in the hood.

## Wine glassware

Make sure you are stocked-up with **all-purpose glass wines**, but for special occassions, add some bougieness.

A good wine glass' shape will enable the aromas upward to swirl and sniff.

A good wine glass should have a stem to avoid passing body heat from your hand to the wine.

A good wine glass should be clear.

A good wine should be slightly thinner, with no flaws in the flow of the glass.

## Talk about wine (helpful terms)

* **Dry**: refers to wines that have little or no residual sugar, not sweet, i.e. most table wines.
* **Fruity**: wines tasting predominantly of fruit. Wines that are very young, or made from very ripe grapes tend to be fruity. As good wine ages, fruitiness evolves into a more complex flavor profile that tastes different than fruit.
* **Savory**: wines tasting predominantly of herbs and spices, salty or smoky.
* **Crisp**: the invigorating snappiness, often the product of lively acidity.
* **Texture**: how a wine feels in the mouth. It might seem light and ethereal or heavy and viscous.
* **Finish**: the lasting impression of a wine after you swallow a sip. The aftertaste that lingers in the mouth. A longer finish is much appreciated.
* **Nose**: how a wine smells.
