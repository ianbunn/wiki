# Wine Pairings with Food

1. Start with conventional wisdom
   * Experiences knows best, personal preferences over rules
   * Match the richness and body of the food with the weight of the wine
   * Think regionally, choose wines from the same region as the recipe
   * Sweet wines usually DO NOT pair well with desserts
