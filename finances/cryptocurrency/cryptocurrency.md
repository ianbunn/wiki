## Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin follows the laws of physics very closely. Satoshi Nakamoto really thought of every possible law of physics to engineer a monetary system that would hold true to the laws.

## Notes from Google Doc

### Cryptocurrencies

#### Binance (BNB)

**Binance** is led by Changpeng Zhao (CZ), previously at BTC wallet provider Blockchain LLC and one of China’s largest exchanges, **OKCoin**.

Since the launch of **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**, BNB has been increasingly used as both the gas of smart contract execution and for staking.

Currently, BNB can be used to lower trading fees by the amount held, coupled with the client’s trading volume.

Binance’s fee revenues come from:

* Trading
* Withdrawal
* Listing
* Margin trading
* Other fees, such as automated algorithm trading orders

Binance initially promised to buyback BNB from the open market, up to 100 million tokens or 50% of fully diluted total supply.

In March 2019, Binance announced the BNB in the treasury would be burned based on “volumes”. Their treasury has 32 million frozen and 16.5 million circulating BNB. The frozen 32 million are from the 5 year vesting plan for the team.

At the current run rate of burn over the last 12 months (LTM) and at the current BNB prices, there are 6 more years until the max of 100 million tokens are burned. Currently the buyback program is 28% completed.

In 2017, regulators cracked down on ICOs that tried to circumvent securities regulations. After, utility tokens don’t allow ownership stakes but only allow the right to access a service, membership rights, the ability to redeem a product and governance rights. Therefore, relative valuation across utility exchange tokens is a good place to start to compare data.

After examining BNB’s burn yield’s, P/E, Price/Sales, transactions per day, and regulatory risks, BNB could be valued at $43.50 per BNB.
Stably (USDS)
Stably is a USD-pegged stablecoin on Tezos blockchain, which moved away from ETH blockchain.

Stably was built upon FA2 token standard and issued by Prime Trust, a Nevada, USA company.

USDS will use TZIP-15 and TZIP-17 for lightweight token permissioning and gas relaying
ETH’s gas costs was rising high

Tezos (XTZ)
Tezos stands out in its ability to routinely coordinate protocol upgrades and implement functionality improvements.

It is a DeFi ecosystem that provides:
Low gas costs
Institutional-grade security
Scheduled protocol upgrades

Delphi protocol upgrade
Gas costs went down by 75%

Notes
Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
DeFi refers to applications on public blockchains aiming to create financial services w/out centralized intermediaries.

DeFi is a potential long-term, world-altering future, where individuals can coordinate financial activities peer-to-peer at a global scale. DeFi represents the infrastructure, such as lending platforms and exchanges required to innovate upon the traditional financial systems.

Traditional  financial systems mostly consist of centralized database systems littered with rent seeking middlemen, high fees and hold-ups. With DeFi, closed financial systems can be transformed into an open financial economy based on open source protocols that are more accessible, with fewer intermediaries, and more transparent.

Since most of these new financial protocols use smart contracts, they are both programmable and interoperable.

DeFi has the potential to open up necessary financial services including the ability to borrow funds, take out loans, deposit funds into a savings account, or trade complex financial products, all without asking anyone for permission.

Top DeFi tokens:
Maker
Aave
Uniswap
Compound
Synthetix
DeFi and ETH
ETH sets itself apart from BTC by making it easier to build other types of decentralized apps beyond simple transactions. ETH currently settles billions in transactions everyday without requiring a corporation like the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) to ensure a transaction is completed.
Metaverses
Metaverses are virtual worlds where it combines 2 emerging technologies - VR, blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

The real value of any community whether in a video game or on social media comes from the players and content creators. A game or virtual world without one’s friends, influencers, or altruistic strangers is valueless.

Virtual worlds built with blockchain technology offer a new social contract for our digital lives predicated upon digital ownership and free markets.

Free markets facilitate creativity and value creation, while digital property rights ensure value developed in the market is imbued to the creator(s).

3 potential ways to play the growth of metaverses:
Application native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) specifically built for usage
Governance tokens (price appreciation and distribution of fees from speculative activities)
Digital land speculation and revenue generation
While digital land is a NFT in itself, digital plots have the opportunity to be productive assets that have cash flow generating businesses built on them

Digital land has the potential to be one of the most profitable growth plays since it can be a productive asset within a social system. However, digital land requires the longest investment time horizon since adoption to date has been slow.

The parcels of digital land that accrue the most value will be in the locations that receive the most frequent user traffic and therefore will likely be the most developed. Earning a significant return on digital land will require putting time or capital into developing a digital oasis.

The time-intensive nature of digital land means that passive holders will find it easier to make money by trading NFTs or speculating on governance tokens.
NFTs will accrue value as a metaverse grows with the potential to achieve collectible status amongst metaverse enthusiasts

Examples
In-game crypto$ or governance tokens (e.g. AXS) that provide a cash flow will benefit proportionally to the growth of the digital world.
In-game crypto$ that DO NOT provide a cash flow (e.g. MANA) are unlikely to appreciate proportionally to the virtual worlds.

Another consideration is the liquidity of one’s investment. NFTs remain less liquid than governance tokens, which increases the risk profile of purchasing digital land in hopes of appreciation.

The key is to find what category of assets to buy in virtual worlds, and the challenging part is predicting which worlds will gain the most traction.
Mataverses: 2020
Currently dominated by 5 players:
Axie Infinity
Cryptovoxels
Decentraland
Somnium Space
The Sandbox

### Crypto mining

The Chinese mining centralization of Bitcoin and Ethereum
https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2021/12/29/the-chinese-mining-centralization-of-bitcoin-and-ethereum/?sh=6a52f5ed2f66

Mining pools might have a geographic area/base, but miners (and their hash rate and hardware) can switch their loyalty.

If rewards and technical conditions change, a shift towards mining pools based in China can move to US or EU
Electricity rates matter for mining pool operations
Sichuan, China provides cheap hydroelectricity
Political factors such as State cutting down energy to a specific geographical area, etc.

Mining pools are more loyal to whichever incentives help them make more money.

Mining pools derive value from proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.
