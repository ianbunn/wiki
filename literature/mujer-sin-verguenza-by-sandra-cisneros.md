# Mujer Sin Verguenza

By Sandra Cisneros

From the start, the first poem captivates with its authenticity and honesty. There's an underlying tone of hope in her poetry that makes me want to continue reading, maybe Cisneros is making a dent in the universe, which we need to all pitch in to really change the course. We should all learn from her experiences, and show humility and altruism in our works.

Her feminism is very-well reflected in her choice of words, and thinking of the "cantarito" from "la loteria", what a genius juxtaposition to bring in a powerful image of a woman that fills and is filled, that carries and is carried.

Cisneros brings a lot of her familiar experiences in South Texas to convey a unique setting for her poems.

The writer promotes a life of solitude and self-reflection, away from the crowds and commotions.

The closing poems are raw as they can be, and the reader can see the layers of flesh in the words. The poetic words and the strong female perspective on sex makes this a must-read for all males.

Some of my favorite poems:

- "El Jardín, Fin Del Día" poem brings back a lot of memories from my time in Mexico
- "Lo Que No Se Menciona En Las Noticias" really hits home as well, the socioeconomic boundaries set between the characters in the poem really show our current world and brings the political problems between two nations to light, Mexico/USA
- "Canto Para Mujeres De Cierto Llanto" was another favorite with a deep connection to tragedy and bravery, and definitely highlighting her strong feminist ideas, in contrary to the traditional "macho" image from Mexico
- "Habiendo Recientemente Escapado de las Fauces De Una Mortal Vida, Estoy Lista para Comenzar el Año Nuevo" has a joyful way to look at things, and got a really nice quote from there that I saved in my quote bank:
  - "solo leeré por placer o metamorfosis", translation: I will only read for pleasure or metamorphosis, simple but deep
- "Instrucciones Para Hacer Vigilia Con El Moribundo" really connects with anyone that has suffered from the loss of a loved one, close and dear to them
- "En Caso De Duda" has a nice closing tone to it and is perfectly placed at the ending section, “Pilón” and gives that moral of the story sense to the reader
