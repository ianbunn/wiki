# Mujer Sin Verguenza

By Sandra Cisneros

From the start, the first poem captivates with its authenticity and honesty.

There's an underlying tone of hope in her poetry that makes me want to continue reading, maybe Sandra is making a dent in the universe, which we need to all pitch in to really change the course.

Her feminism is very-well reflected in her choice of words, and thinking of the "cantarito" from "la loteria", what a genius juxtaposition to bring in a powerful image of a woman that fills and is filled, that carries and is carried.
