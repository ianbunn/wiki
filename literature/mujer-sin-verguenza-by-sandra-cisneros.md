# Mujer Sin Verguenza

By Sandra Cisneros

From the start, the first poem captivates with its authenticity and honesty.

There's an underlying tone of hope in her poetry that makes me want to continue reading, maybe Cisneros is making a dent in the universe, which we need to all pitch in to really change the course.

Her feminism is very-well reflected in her choice of words, and thinking of the "cantarito" from "la loteria", what a genius juxtaposition to bring in a powerful image of a woman that fills and is filled, that carries and is carried.

Cisneros brings a lot of her familiar experiences in South Texas to convey a unique setting for her poems.

The writer promotes a life of solitude and self-reflection, away from the crowds and commotions.

Some of my favorite poems:

- "El Jardín, Fin Del Día" poem brings back a lot of memories from my time in Mexico
- "Lo Que No Se Menciona En Las Noticias" really hits home as well, the socioeconomic boundaries set between the characters in the poem really show our current world and brings the political problems between two nations to light, Mexico/USA
