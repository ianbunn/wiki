# What Happened To You?

Conversations on Trauma, Resilience, and Healing

By Bruce D. Perry, Oprah Winfrey

## Introduction

The question "What Happened To You?" and the title of the book suggests a shift to the psychology paradigm of trauma care, or better yet, "trauma-informed care".

## Chapter 1 - Making Sense of the World

When children are born, they require a lot of attention, care and love. If they lack the essential caring qualities, then the children grow tendencies to self-sabotage, violence, promiscuity, or addiction.

That lack of essential care creates trauma, and it influences how the brain develops and works all throughout life.

This is how the brain is supposed to work. Its defensive mechanisms. However, healing must take place.

All the care and love we are given as children shape our personal history, and it influences our unique way of seeing things and reactions to things. This is our own "personal codebook" that helps us interpret the world.

Traumatic experiences or adverse experiences can create complex memory traces that involve all regions of the brain. Our "core regulatory networks" (CRN) in turn becomes "dysregulated".

## Chapter 2 - Seeking Balance

Regulation is the key to creating a safe connection.

How to regulate one self? There are many techniques, but here are some:

- Assign a sacred personal space to regulate
- Block out time as "renewal" events on your calendar
- Meditation
- Find what naturally soothes you
- Perform an activity that puts you at ease
- Rhythmic activities such as dancing or singing
- Belonging to a community

When we get back into balance and regulated state, it activates the reward networks in the brain. We feel pleasure. Balance is the core of health.

Our brain is a meaning-making machine, always trying to make sense of the world, so we are constantly taxing our stress-response systems.

Sometimes this leads to us creating a self-fulfilling prophecy; we project what we expect, and that helps elicit what we expect. However, what we project is based upon what happened to us as children.

### Dysregulated and Imbalanced State

With balance comes imbalance, so our body created this "fight or flight" mechanism to respond to our fears when we are in the dysregulated, imbalanced state.

Another defense mechanism is dissociation. However, this tends to lead to extreme, ultimately destructive, methods of regulation, but not always.

Most ppl with "developmental adversity" are chronically dysregulated, resulting in tightness and anxiety.

### Fight or Flight

Fun Fact: Term coined in 1915 by stress researcher Walter B. Cannon

### Dissociation

Whereas the physiology of the arousal response is to optimize fight or flight, the physiology of dissociation is to help us rest, replenish, survive, injury, and tolerate pain.

Arousal releases adrenaline; dissociation release the body's own painkillers, enkephalins and endorphins.

Being able to partially dissociate, to disengage from parts of the external threatening world and focus on trained behaviors, is key to success in competitive sport or high pressure performances in the arts.

### Connection To Regulate

Without connection to ppl who care for you and support you, it is almost impossible to step away from any form of unhealthy reward and regulation, i.e. addiction.

## Chapter 3 - How We Were Loved

The brain's capacity to change and adapt to our individual world is outstanding. Neuron and neural networks actually make physical changes when stimulated; neuroplasticity.

A key principle of neuroplasticity is specificity. In order to learn or change that part of the brain, that specific part of the brain must be activated, that's why hands-on is usually the best way to learn a new skill.

If we were not loved as children, how can the unloved become loving?

We are relational creatures, so we are always craving connection. Love is relational superglue. Children without these have a harder time developing.

Really, all aspect of human functioning is influenced by early developmental experiences.

With increasing stress or threat, the dissociative response takes a person deeper and deeper into a protective mode. Often, our responses to these threats are not very "smart". The more threatened or stressed we are, the less access we have to the smart part of our brain, the cortex.

All functioning of the brain is "state-dependent". A person will think, learn, feel, and behave differently when they are afraid compared to when they feel safe.

On occasion, we will be challenged, surprised, or threatened and will move to the "Alarm" state. When this happens, we start to think in more emotional ways as lower systems in the brain begin to dominate our functioning. 

## Chapter 4 - The Spectrum of Trauma

A trauma has 3 key aspects:

- The Event
- The Experience
- The Effects

The specific effects on your health will be determined by a variety of other factors, including genetic vulnerability, the developmental stage at which the traumatic events occurred, history of your previous trauma, your family's history of trauma, and the buffering capacity of healthy relationships, family, and community.

Understanding how patterns of stress can influence regulation, or balance, is the key to understanding how what happened to you is connected too your health - in all domains, mental, physical, and social.

The power of brief but positive caregiving interactions is immense, but it is the timing that is so important. Your history of relational health - your connectedness to family, community, and culture - is more predictive of your mental health than your history of adversity.

Positive human interaction that's nurturing is rewarding, regulating, and bonding.

The mind wants to see what we believe, so it clings to things that support those beliefs - that worldview - and ignores things that don't. But trauma shatters this inner landscape.

As you revisit this shipwreck, piece by piece, you find a fragment and move it to your new, safer place in the now-altered landscape. You build a new worldview. That takes time and resiliency.

The effects of trauma stretch far and wide across generations and across communities, and it's important to always come back to our central question with comparison: What happened to you?

Avoidant behaviors are an attempt to regain control over what feels like the uncontrollability of the traumatic experience. When someone is unavoidable, distressing situation, avoidant behaviors can be protective. They will often long to be connected but find themselves anxious, confused, or overwhelmed when they get close to someone.

## Chapter 5 - Connecting the Dots

The capacity to make associations between sound and image is primarily genetic, but the specific ways we turn that genetic capacity into a language are not. There are no genes for Chinese or English or Spanish.

The cortex gives rise to the most uniquely human capabilities: speech, language, abstract thinking, reflecting on the past, planning, etc.

Racism is a learned set of beliefs about the superiority of a people, and racism in practice is about power, dominance, and oppression.

Many aspects of the human experience are invented - as opposed to simply springing up from our genes. We take place in sociocultural evolution, taking the accumulated, distilled experiences of previous generations and pass them on.

Our media, our institutions and systems, our communities - all are infused with some elements of bias.

Children are sponges, and that neuroplasticity allows them to absorb the language of their parents, along with their beliefs, good and bad, of influential adults.

However, generational transmission of bias can be disrupted. Our actions matter. We're impacting the next generations. Are we being mindful of our actions?

Some aspects of our stress-response systems are "heritable"; there are genetic mechanisms that play a role in how our CRNs function.

Every cell in our body has the same genes, but not every cell has the same genes "turned on". As cells become specialized, many of their genes are shut off.

Environments and challenges change, if we are to stay in balance, so must our physiology.

Developmental trauma can disrupt our ability to form and maintain relationships. There's even risk for repeating trans-generational patterns of abuse.

If trauma has altered CRNs, there will be pervasive regulation problems, such as regulation of blood sugar and insulin release.

Belonging is biology, and disconnection destroys our health.

If any of the input is a match to a stored memory from past experience, the lower brain reacts as though the past experience is happening now.

To reason with another person, we need to effectively get through the lower areas of their brain and reach their cortex, the part responsible for thinking, including problem-solving and reflective cognition.

Effective communication, teaching, coaching, parenting, and therapeutic input require awareness of, and adherence to, the sequence of engagement. Regulate, Relate, and Reason.

Communication is about getting some idea, concept or story from your cortex to another person's cortex.

The problem is that we don't communicate from cortex to cortex. All the thoughts from our cortex have to get through the emotional filters of the lower brain. Our facial expressions, tone of voice, and words are turned into neural activity by the other person's senses, and then the sequential process of matching, interpreting, and passing up to their cortex takes place.

## Chapter 6 - From Coping to Healing

An infant's dominant adaptive response to stress is to disengage from the confusing, threatening world and retreat into their inner world.

The longer an individual spends in a deprived developmental environment, the harder it will be to recover.

The trauma cycle - shame, pain, booze, rage, humiliation, and loss - accelerates the family's fragmentation.

### Not Fully Present Caregivers

A dismissive interaction is not building the foundation for a loving person. On the contrary, it fuels an emotional needy person who will long for belonging but won't have the neurobiological capability to really find what they need.

### In The Zone Flow

Dissociation can be good when engaged healthily as the terms "flow" or "in the zone" are used to describe.

Hypnosis, flow, being "in the zone" - all of these are examples of the trance state that dissociation allows. Ppl who learn to control when and how they go into a trance state have a gift.

Learn to use boundaries and intention to make the pattern of your life's stress more predictable, controllable, and moderate. That is a healing and resilience-building pattern of stress activation.

An intention precedes every thought and every action, and that outcome of your experiences is determined by your intention going in. Always ask yourself before taking something on, "What is my intention in doing this?".

### The Familiar

The key point is that all of us tend to gravitate to the familiar, even when the familiar is unhealthy or destructive. Whatever your past experiences created in your brain, the associations exist and you can't just delete them. Therapy is about building new associations, making new, healthier defaults.

It's almost as if therapy takes your two-lane dirt road and building a four-lane freeway alongside it. The old road stays, but you don't use it much anymore.

## Chapter 7 - Post-Traumatic Wisdom

The hardest thing to understand is that nothing and no one can take away the pain from a trauma.

The healing from trauma leads us down the painful path to wisdom.

Adversity impacts everyone. What the impact will be, when it may manifest, how it may be "buffered" - we can't always say. One sure thing is that it will always influence our body and brain.

Our stress-response capabilities expand when they get "practice". A supportive parent, teacher, coach also helps provide the proper "dosing" of challenges for the child to develop. Challenges shoudl fit the child's developmental stage, bc impossible challenges setup children to fail.

Failure is an important part of the process. This is where the learning comes from.

If someone has a life w/chaotic, uncontrollable or extreme and prolonged stress, particularly early in life, they're more likely to act before thinking. Their cortex is not as active and reactivity in the lower areas of the brain becomes more dominant.

You can't talk someone out of feeling angry, sad, or frustrated, but you can be a sponge and absorb their emotional intensity. If you stay regulated, ultimately they will "catch your cool".

The sensory elements of the natural world bathe us with their own regulating rhythms.

The journey from traumatized to typical to resilient helps create a unique strength and perspective. That journey can create post-traumatic wisdom.

In ancient times, the pillars of traditional healing were:

1. Connection to clan and the natural world
2. Regulating rhythm through dance, drumming, and song
3. A set of beliefs, values, and stories that brought meaning to even senseless, random trauma
4. Natural hallucinogens or other plant-derived substances used to facilitate healing with the guidance of a healer or elder

Resiliency is a capability that can wax and wane, not a permanent, innate trait. Everyone needs ppl who can listen, be present, and make them feel heard and seen. "I see you".

We heal best in community. A healthy community is a healing community, and a healing community is full of hope it has seen its own ppl weather - survive and thrive.

## Chapter 8 - Our Brains, Our Biases, Our Systems

Individual ppl develop their unique "worldview", so do systems and organizations; they develop a dominant perspective.

Trauma permeates all aspects of life; it echoes through generations, across families, communities, institutioins, cultures, and socieites, and it does so in very complex ways.

If we don't recognize the built-in biases in ourselves and the structural biases in our systems, biases regarding race, gender, sexual orientation - we can't truly be trauma-informed.

The more we learn about trauma and stress response, the easier it is to understand certain behaviors we encounter in our lives.

Somatosensory regulation, such as rhythm, opens up the cortex and makes the reasoning parts of the brain accessible for learning. 

There are other resilience building activities like sports, music, and art. There are cognitive elements to sports, music, and other arts. They engage, activate, and synchronize activity throughout the brain, from the bottom up and from the top down. These are whole-brain healthy activities.

A truly trauma-aware clinical team has a lot of "tools" to use:

- Occupational therapy
- Speech therapy
- Physical therapy
- Liaisons with the school
- Psychoeducation with the family and child
- Access to a range of therapeutic techniques
  - Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBF)
  - Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)
  - Somatosensory interventions
  - Animal-assisted therapies

Aboriginal healing practices are repetitive, rhythmic, relevant, relational, respectful, and rewarding - experiences known to be effective in altering neural systems involved in the stress response.

The brain is always using "shortcuts". These shortcuts are not always accurate; they make us vulnerable to stereotypes and "isms" - generalizing attributes of ppl based upon the broad categories they fall into. We all create our own version of the world that has distortions. The brain's shortcuts in processing info make us vulnerable to bias.

The earliest relational experiences are the most powerful and enduring. However, we are also profoundly influenced by the media. The cortex is the most malleable, the most changeable part of the brain.

Moderate, predictable, controllable stress can build resilience. Create new associations; have new experiences. Ideally, go out into the community and spend time w/ppl who are diff than you are. You need to create, real meaningful relationships so that you get to know individuals based on their unique qualities, not based on categories.

There is no training for "cultural sensitivity" - you spend time immersed in that culture, spending time with different ppl.

Angry, polarized groups don't listen well, but they are communicating fear and pain and hunger for change.

## Chapter 9 - Relational Hunger in the Modern World

To best understand the here and now, we need to know where we come from and "what happened" to us and our ancestors.

The Maori culture has a very strong sense of community. When someone speaks in a group, they go to a corner where everyone can see them ,and they can see everyone. They would first explain the tracing of their ancestral heritage to bring a continuous appreciation of cross-generational connections. Then they would speak, often using storytelling to make a point.

In Western psychiatry, we like to separate and categorize everything. This misses the true essence of the problem. We are chasing symptoms, not healing ppl.

According to the Maori, pain, distress and dysfunction would arise from some from of fragmentation, disconnection, dyssynchrony. Which is what colonization brought about to our ancestors breaking apart community cohesion and cultures, and that disconnection is at the heart of trauma.

A core element of all the traditional healing practices was something the Maori called "whanaungatanga". The word refers to reciprocal relationships, kinship, and a sense of family connection. The collective "we" of a community heals. We are all healers.

We shouldn't be walking away from a conversation in a rage; we should regulate ourselves. Repair the ruptures. Reconnect and grow. When you walk away, everybody loses.

"The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom." -Isaac Asimov

The constant monitoring of the social environment can consume a significant portion of our bandwidth. We use artificial light to stay awake at night. The foods we eat are extremely processed - profoundly diff from the foods that our bodies evolved to digest. All of this stresse our body, especially the brain.

The best predictor of your current mental health is your current "relational health", or connectedness.

This connectedness is fueled by 2 things:

1. The basic capabilities you've developed to form and maintain relationships
2. The relational "opportunities" you have in your family, neighborhood, school, and so forth

In a multifamily, multigenerational environment, the continuous social interactions provide a rich source of regulation, reward, and learning.

Fewer relational interactions, they'll still develop social capabilities, they'll just be less mature, more self-centered, more self-absorbed.

Our current society is more concerned about extrinsic goals, rather than intrinsic, such as community, meaning in life, and affiliation.

Disconnection in our society are playing a major role in the increased anxiety, sleep disorders, substance use, and depression we're seeing.

We're now raising our children in environments that are both relationally impoverished and sensory overloading from the proliferation of screen-based technologies.

We need more quiet conversational moments listening to a friend with no other distractions. That kind of interaction leads to a completely deep human connection.

Activating our stress-response systems, even at a moderate level, for long periods of time is physically and emotionally exhausting. The brain can also only take so many relationships that are meaningful, about 80-100, the size of a large hunter-gatherer band.

## Chapter 10 - What We Need Now

Focus on being present and regulate yourself when you start feeling frustrated, disrespected, or angry, bc they have not listened to you.

The brain develops, processes incoming sensory input, and heals in sequence.

Trauma and adversity, in a way, are gifts. What we do with these gifts will differ from person to person. The cost of wisdom can be very high. And for many ppl, the pain never goes away.

The wise learn how to carry their burden with grace, often to protect others from the emotional intensity of their pain.

Until you heal the wounds of your past, you will continue to bleed.

The core elements are awareness coupled with connectedness.

Forgiving is giving up the hope that the past could have been any different. But we cannot move forward if we're still holding on to the pain of the past.
