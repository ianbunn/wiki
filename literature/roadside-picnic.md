# Roadside Picnic

By Arkady & Boris Strugatsky

Short and sweet, Strugatsky has a way with describing ephemeral, beautiful moments that paint a detailed cinema for everyone to watch.

In some dystopian time, Aliens visited the Earth and saw humans with their mess, so Aliens went ahead and left theirs. These Aliens’ messes are called “The Zones”, and treasure hunters or “stalkers” go and hunt Alien trash for cash. These “stalkers” are seen as the scum of society, and frankly, frowned upon by their own employers that seek out Alien trash.

“Stalkers” might be the lowest of the low, but sometimes, science creeps into the crevices of the unknown and the masses run away from it, so it is the “stalkers” duty to evolve our science with Alien science. They sacrifice everything to delve into the abyss of the “Zones”.

The Alien tech is romantically compared to how alchemy, I suppose, used to be seen. How the actual Alien tech might do something completely different to what the humans are using it for, but nonetheless, sacrificing their lives for it, for the improvement of science and humanity.

Some quotes I collected from the book:

“Praise assuages our insecurities”, isn’t that so, fellow Humanoids?

“The problem is we don’t notice the years pass, he thought. Screw the years — we don’t notice things change. We know that things change, we’ve been told since childhood that things change, we’ve witnessed things change ourselves many a time, and yet we are still utterly incapable of noticing the moment that change comes — or we search for change in all the wrong places.”

“Intelligence is the ability to harness the powers of the surrounding world without destroying the said world.”

“Mankind’s most impressive achievement is that it has survived and intends to continue doing so.”

“A man needs money in order to never think about it.”
