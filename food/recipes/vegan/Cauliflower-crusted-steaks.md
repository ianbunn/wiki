# Cauliflower crusted steaks

Pistachios contain good cholesterol and tons of anti-oxidants plus B vitamins.

Ingredients

- 2 tsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp coconut oil
- 1/2 cup hemp heart seeds
- 1/4 cup pistachios
- zest from 1 lemon
- 1 medium/large head of cauliflower
- sea salt and peper to taste

Instructions

1. Pre-heat oven to 400f degrees and prep a baking sheet with parchment paper
2. On the stove top, place a cast iron pan or large grilling skillet
3. Chop cauliflower head into steaks by first removing outer leaves, and slicing the cauliflower head in half (get 3 to 4 steaks out of it, but make sure most of the florets stay intact on the steak)
4. In a food processor or blender, grind pistachios into small chunks (about the same size as your hemp seeds)
5. Mix in a bowl with hemp seeds and 2 tsp olive oil until the mixture is slightly soft but not overly oily, then set aside
6. Season cauliflower with salt and pepper to taste
7. Heat your skillet/grill pan over medium-high with a bit of coconut oil or using a grill spray is great too in order to cover the surface
8. Once the pan is hot, add your cauliflower steaks (as many as will fit comfortably)
9. You want to sear them, approx. 3-4 minutes on each side
10. Add each seared piece to your parchment-lined baking sheet as they are ready
11. Once you're all done searing each piece, grab your hemp-pistachio crust and start pressing it on top of one side of the cauliflower steak
12. The oil you added to the mixture will help this stick to the cauliflower and help it to not burn while it's in the oven
13. Now add the lemon zest over top and pop the baking sheet into the oven
14. Roast for 15 minutes at 400f degrees
15. Then reduce to 300f degrees for approx. 5-7 minutes
16. The edges of the cauliflower should be browned slightly and you should be able to easily stick the middle with a fork but it should still be sturdy, if you want it softer, keep it in a little longer, but WATCH YOUR CRUST so it doesn't burn
