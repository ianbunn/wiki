# Chocolate Covered Strawberries

## Ingredients

* 1 lb strawberries
* 8 oz 60% bittersweet milk chocolate
* 8 oz white chocolate chips
* 1 tsp olive oil or sunflower oil
* Pistachios (chopped)
* Walnuts (chopped
* Coconut (chopped)

## Instructions

1. Wash and rinse strawberries, then dry them individually with a paper towel.
    - Dry them very well, then air dry them for 30-60 minutes at room temperature
2. Place the chocolate in microwave-safe bowl, microwave for 20 second intervals
    - Stir chocolate after every 20 second interval, until melted
    - It takes about 3-4 intervals = 60-80 seconds
    - DO NOT OVERHEAT CHOCOLATE, stop microwaving if little bits are left, as they should melt after stirring one last time
3. Stir the oil into chocolate until shiny and smooth consistency
    - 1 full tsp when using bittersweet chocolate
    - 1/2 tsp when using semisweet, milk or white chocolate
4. Set a sheet of wax paper or parchment paper on a large tray
5. Dip each strawberry into the chocolate
    - Gently scrape the excess chocolate off the bottom using the lip of the bowl, then place on paper-lined tray
6. OPTIONAL
    - Use the white chocolate to contrast the milk chocolate
        - In a sandwich bag, put a little bit of the contrasting chocolate and tear a corner on the bag to use as a pouring tool
    - Use the chopped pistachios, walnuts or coconut with the milk chocolate covered strawberries to add some texture
7. Let the strawberries sit for about an hour at room temperatureâ€¦ENJOY!

**NOTE**: DO NOT REFRIGERATE! Or strawberries will get mealy and soggy.
