## Notes

- This cleansing receipe is oil-free because avoiding the use of oil during a cleansing meal is important for the detoxification process (and you won't miss the oil at all due to all the flavor), but if you feel like cooking with oil, use a minimal amount - 1 tablespoon or less
- Leftovers stay well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days
